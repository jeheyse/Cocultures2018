The reference FCM data (approx. 1GB) for the cooling water system and Lake Michigan/Muskegon Lake are available from here and here. These data should be stored in a directory called data_reference with subdirectories FCM_CW for the cooling water data and FCM_MI for the Lake Michigan and Muskegon Lake data.
